# TODO List for future maintainers

## Enhancements

- Attachments
- Multiple Recipients
- CC/BCC
- Cache more data (smarter refresh)
- More resilient configurations
  - No passwords in plaintext?
- Man-pages? (not all that much to document, but maybe)
- Background refresh
- Save sent mails to the 'Sent' folder via IMAP
- Folder selection (probably in the upper-bar)
- Drafts (edition & saving)
